Goals
-------

Create the biggest open data Physics formula database in multiple languages.

Create a complex cross-platform Physics problem solver with linked formulas. 


Current Stage
---------------

- 900 Physics formulas browser with searching capabilities
- 150 formulas (starred) have a problem solver feature, which permits fast result calculations.
- available languages: English and Romanian. Translatable in any other languages by volunteers.
- editing module has been started and you can modify the existing data.

Plans
------

- module for adding new formulas
- showing the editor's credentials for each formula
- showing contributor ratings
